## Quickstart

Audience: Users with no prior codebase knowledge.

When to use: You want to parse a small belief base, construct a `PreOCF`, compute ranks, and check a few conditionals within minutes.

What you'll learn:
- Parse belief bases and queries using `parser.Wrappers`
- Create a `PreOCF` (System Z)
- Compute ranks and check conditional acceptance

Prerequisites:
- Installed dev environment per `INSTALL.md`

Steps:
1) Parse a tiny belief base and queries
2) Build a `PreOCF` with System Z
3) Compute ranks and inspect a few worlds
4) Check conditional acceptance

Planned snippet (single source of truth):

```python
# Snippet will be included from ../../show_preocf_minimal.py
# between markers [docs:quickstart-minimal:start] and ...:end
# once markers are added.
```

Notes:
- The code above will be included from `show_preocf_minimal.py` once markers are added.
- For details, see API: `inference.preocf.PreOCF`, `parser.Wrappers`.
