## PreOCF Basics

Goal: Understand ranks, world encoding, verbose views, and total preorders.

You will:
- Create a `PreOCF` (System Z)
- Compute some ranks and all ranks
- View ranks in verbose form and convert ranks â†” TPO

Snippets (planned to be included from `show_preocf.py`):

### Create System Z and compute some ranks
```python
# Will include from ../../show_preocf.py once markers exist:
# [docs:preocf-basics:system-z:start] ... :end
```

### Compute all ranks and verbose representation
```python
# Will include from ../../show_preocf.py once markers exist:
# [docs:preocf-basics:verbose:start] ... :end
```

### Convert ranks to total preorder (TPO)
```python
# Will include from ../../show_preocf.py once markers exist:
# [docs:preocf-basics:tpo:start] ... :end
```
